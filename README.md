## üìö Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching Conversations

```typescript
import { cosmic } from '@/lib/cosmic'

async function getConversations(userId: string) {
  try {
    const response = await cosmic.objects
      .find({
        type: 'conversations',
        'metadata.user': userId
      })
      .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
      .depth(1)
    
    return response.objects
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 404) {
      return []
    }
    throw error
  }
}
```

### Creating a New Conversation

```typescript
async function createConversation(data: {
  userId: string
  modelId: string
  title: string
  message: string
}) {
  const response = await cosmic.objects.insertOne({
    type: 'conversations',
    title: data.title,
    metadata: {
      user: data.userId,
      title: data.title,
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: data.message,
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        }
      ],
      model_used: data.modelId,
      total_tokens: 0,
      status: 'active',
      last_activity: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  })
  
  return response.object

async function createImageGeneration(data: {
  userId: string
  prompt: string
  imageUrl: string
  resolution: string
  stylePreset: string
}) {
  const response = await cosmic.objects.insertOne({
    type: 'image-generations',
    title: data.prompt.substring(0, 50),
    metadata: {
      user: data.userId,
      prompt: data.prompt,

## üîó Cosmic CMS Integration

This application uses Cosmic CMS to manage all content with five interconnected object types:

### Object Types

1. **Users** - User profiles with subscription tiers and usage limits
2. **Conversations** - Chat history with messages and model tracking
3. **AI Models** - Available AI models with capabilities and pricing
4. **System Prompts** - Pre-configured conversation templates
5. **Image Generations** - Generated images with edit history

All content is fetched dynamically from your Cosmic bucket and displayed in real-time. The application uses depth parameter to include related objects (users, models) in conversation queries.
